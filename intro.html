    <h2>Note about the upcoming e-commerce platform</h2>
    <!-- REPLACED CONTENT STARTS -->
    <p>
      <strong>Better Buy</strong> now wants to expand its offerings and intends to launch styling services. Better Buy, earlier offering shopping products and services, has now recently launched styling services. Now a consumer can explore different styling ideas for the clothing products.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a consumer who recently bought jeans from Better Buy can explore which shirt/top goes well with the jeans, and which shoes/sandals style with the jeans.
